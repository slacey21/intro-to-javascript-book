4. Does the following code produce an error? Why or why not? 
What output does this code send to the console?

for (let i = 0; i < 5;) {
  console.log(i += 1);
}

ANSWER:
NO error. Because there is no increment / decrement statement in this for loop
it will print 1 to the console an infinite number of times.
